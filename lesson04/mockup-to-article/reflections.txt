Your response goes here!

  * What new skills have you learned?

  I have varying degree of knowledge of using HTML. This was a good re-fresher on the HTML basics.

  * What has been easy?
  
  Navigating through the course materials and receiving assistance from mentors and fellow students.

  * What has been difficult?

    Ensuring I read all the instructions. Like most people, my eagerness to do task I gloss over the instructions and details. But, I'm getting better that paying attention to the details.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

    I always try to use the Read-Search-Ask methodology.

    1. Read the documentation or error
    2. Search Google
    3. Ask for help
