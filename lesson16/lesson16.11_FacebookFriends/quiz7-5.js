Directions:
Create an object called facebookProfile. The object should have 3 properties:

1. your name
2. the number of friends you have, and
3. an array of messages you've posted (as strings)

The object should also have 4 methods:

1. postMessage(message) - adds a new message string to the array
2. deleteMessage(index) - removes the message corresponding to the index provided
3. addFriend() - increases the friend count by 1
4. removeFriend() - decreases the friend count by 1
